An Adobe After Effects script that automatically creates professional slideshows from folders of images.

## Features

- **Automatic Slideshow Creation**: Transform folders of images into slideshows with just a few clicks
- **Two Slideshow Styles**:
  - **Normal**: Classic cross-fades with smooth zoom animation
  - **Blur**: Special treatment for portrait photos with elegant blurred backgrounds
- **Batch Processing**: Process all subfolders at once, creating separate slideshows for each
- **Automatic Looping**: Creates looping compositions automatically
- **Time-Saving**: What used to take 15+ minutes now takes seconds

## Why Lazy Slideshow?

As a media professional working on a national TV network, I created this tool out of necessity. Each TV episode required at least 10 different slideshows which was incredibly time-consuming! This script has saved countless hours of tedious work.
